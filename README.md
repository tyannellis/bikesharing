## Summary
This analysis shows that are over 2 million trips. The target market based on this analysis would be males as they make up the majority of subscribers. It will be essential to have enough bikes for demand during the popular morning and evening hours. I would suggest taking the starting Places visualization further and highlighting the types of places people start their biking not just exact locations and I would also repeat this for the ending places. This is because it will be important to see how these locations compare to the locations in des Moines
